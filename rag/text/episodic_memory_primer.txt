EPISODIC MEMORY - DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE

Definition:
Episodic memory is the autobiographical recall of specific past events,
including the associated time, place, and emotions.

Core Components (What vs. When vs. Where vs. Why):
- WHAT: Specific events, experiences, interactions
- WHEN: Temporal markers (dates, times, sequences, "yesterday at 3pm")
- WHERE: Spatial context (locations, environments, "in the living room")
- WHY: Emotional significance (feelings, importance, impact)

Memory Types (for context):
1. Episodic Memory: Personal experiences with context
   - Example: "I remember analyzing the episodic memory PDF on November 29th"

2. Semantic Memory: General knowledge without context
   - Example: "Episodic memory is a type of long-term memory"

3. Procedural Memory: Skills and habits
   - Example: "Knowing how to extract text from PDFs"

Key Characteristics:
- Autobiographical: Personal to the individual
- Contextual: Rich in temporal and spatial details
- Emotionally charged: Often involves feelings
- Reconstructive: Can be recalled and reflected upon
- Associative: Triggered by cues (smells, sounds, keywords)

Relevance to This System:
Alfred stores interactions as episodic memories, capturing not just WHAT
was analyzed, but WHEN it happened, WHERE files were located, and WHY
the user cared about it. This enables richer recall and better context
for future interactions.
